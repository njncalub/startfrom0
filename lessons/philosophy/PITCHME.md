### [Pastafarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)

Our pasta, who art in a colander, draining be your noodles.

Thy noodle come, Thy sauce be yum, on top some grated Parmesan.

Give us this day our garlic bread, and forgive us our trespasses,

And lead us not into vegetarianism, but deliver us some pizza,
for thine is the meatball, the onion, and the bay leaves,
forever and ever.

R'Amen.
